##  Key Focus Areas

- Patient waiting time analysis  
- Peak vs off-peak congestion  
- Doctor workload distribution  
- Department-level performance  
- Data quality assessment

##  Purpose

This project showcases how data can support hospital management in improving efficiency, patient experience, and operational visibility — not just reporting numbers, but understanding *why* and *where* improvements can be made.

##  How This Helps

- Identifies bottlenecks in patient flow
- Highlights uneven doctor utilization
- Reveals predictable peak-hour pressure points
- Exposes data quality gaps that affect decision making
